Firstly you need to download pytesseract exe file (i have provided the file in this repository)
Then open 'play.typeracer.com' and enter join race after that scroll a little below such that the text that we need to type is right below the search bar.
(i have provided the screenshot highlighting the area that the program is capturing)
Then run the program 3 seconds before the race starts and open the typeracer tab. (I also uploaded the screenshot after the race ended)
Now sitback, relax and watch the magic of pyautogui unfold.
